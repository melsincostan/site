For a while I've had a [Belkétre](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Belk%C3%A8tre/4240) long-sleeved shirt.
At some point, since the logo on it is pretty high and there are no other designs around it, I got the idea to turn it into a crop top.
I wanted to do this in a non-destructive way, though.

Up until now, I had a first version where i tucked the lower half inside the rest and held it using safety pins.
This worked great, but if you knew where to look the pins were visible, and I was always worried about squishing myself into one or something painful like that (although this never materialized).
Another issue with that is that there were only a total of 4 pins holding it up, so 8 points.
Here is how that looked on the inside:

Tonight I replaced this safety pin solution by sewing around the entire thing.
Since I don't really want to figure out how to get my hands on a sewing machine, I had to do it by hand.
This was surprisingly fast, it took maybe an hour and a half to two hours?
Of course it would have been a matter of minutes with a sewing machine but it is what it is UmU
Here is a pic of the bullshit I had to do to not fuck up the design (which is already battered enough as is):

I will try to edit this with a pic of how it looks on someone whenever I can take one, if it looks decent and I remember to do it :3
